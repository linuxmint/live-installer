	<li>Linux Mint is safe and stable, you don't need an antivirus, an anti-spyware, a defragmentation tool or a registry cleaner.</li>
	<li>Receive fixes and security updates all in one place, for the entire system, including the software you install.</li>
	<li>The Linux Mint Update Manager sits discreetly in your system tray and lets you know when updates are available. You don't have to apply updates when you don't want to. The Update Manager won't pop up or annoy you in any way.</li>
