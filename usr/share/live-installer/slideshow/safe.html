	<li>The Linux Mint Update Manager sits discreetly in your system tray and lets you know when updates are available. You don't have to apply updates when you don't want to. The Update Manager won't pop up or annoy you in any way.</li>
	<li>Updates are filtered according to how safe they are to prevent eventual regressions or bugs introduced by them to affect important parts of your system.</li>
